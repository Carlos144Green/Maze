# Maze
This program will start off showing a grid array with buttons at the bottom. 
To generate a maze, click the "Generate maze button". 
This will use an DFS algorithm to pave a way through the grid creating a maze. 
Once the maze is complete, click the "Start BFS" button to traverse the maze.
As the name suggests, this uses BFS to find the fastest path to the end of the maze.

It also has a feature where an image of a maze can be uploaded and translated to a NxM maze(array).
This can then be solved with the same BFS function to have the fastest path located.

This was a fun project for me to do over the summer of 2022 to learn C++ better.
 
I included lots of TODO tasks I plan on implementing later. All help and sugestions are welcome.
