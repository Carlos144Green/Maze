# Maze
This program will start off showing a grid array with buttons at the bottom. To generate a maze, click the "Generate maze button". This will use an DFS algorithm to pave a way through the grid creating a maze. Once the maze is complete, click the "Start BFS" button to traverse the maze. 


I included lots of TODO tasks I plan on implementing later. All help and sugestions are welcome.
